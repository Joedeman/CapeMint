# CapeMint

CapeMint is a hotel website developed using ASP.NET MVC, designed to showcase various aspects of modern web development, such as responsive layouts using Bootstrap, dynamic content with JavaScript, and seamless integration with MVC architecture. This project was part of an assignment, and through it, I gained significant experience working with both front-end and back-end technologies.

## Project Demonstration

Since GitHub does not support direct publishing of ASP.NET applications, you can view a demonstration of how the website works by following this link:
